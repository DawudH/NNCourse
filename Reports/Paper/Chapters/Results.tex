%Results
%Show effect of colorspaces, blur, annealed mean
%Compare results of architecture (images, error plot, feature maps)

In section \ref{sec:method} all the different techniques and methods used resulted in multiple experiments. This sections shows the different results of each experiment, setting the foundation for the discussion in section \ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Colorspace}
To asses the effect of different colorspaces, a comparison is made between CIELab and YCbCr. The compact network is trained on the landscape set for both the YCbCr and CIELab color space, for a total of 20 epochs. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:colorspacecomparison}.
