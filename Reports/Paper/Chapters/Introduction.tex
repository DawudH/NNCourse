\section{Introduction}\label{sec:into}
\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper a deep neural network approach to colorize greyscale images is introduced. Although often automization is already applied on colorization of black and white images, the existing alghorithms still require a lot of input from a user. This paper introduces an algorithm based on a deep neural network architecture that can fully colorize images without the input of a user. High quantities of training data are easily generated by converting RGB images to greyscale for the input and converting to LAB colorspace for the output.
