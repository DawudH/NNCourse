Various techniques exist to colorize grayscale images, however, each requiring a significant amount of human intervention. A promising solution is through the use of neural networks. Throughout this report various methods and properties of neural networks are compared and discussed. It is shown that the many different combinations in components and properties of neural networks can give a vast difference in results, proving the sensitivity of the neural networks.
