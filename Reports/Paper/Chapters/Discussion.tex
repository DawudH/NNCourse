\section{Discussion}

Defining a quantitative performance measure of the networks is outside of the scope of this paper. Therefore a comparison of the results of the five architectures is mainly done by sight.

\subsection{Comparing datasets}
The compact network is the only network that was trained on both the landscape dataset and the fruit dataset. In figure \ref{fig:blur} the final results after 20 epochs on the landscape dataset can be seen. The algorithm seems to color landscapes to good standards. However it is concluded that landscape datasets offer less strain on the CNN, because landscapes contain only a small set of features coupled to colors. For example, trees, sea and grass cover a large amount of the landscape dataset, as opposed to the many classes of fruit in the fruit-dataset. In addition, images of landscapes offer a very low amount of spatial transformation. Strawberries and bananas come in many orientations and shapes, whereas landscapes always have a horizon where the top part is blue and the bottom part is green or brown. Therefore the landscape dataset is labeled to be a low-level test-case of the CNNs, and the fruit-dataset is used as a better performance measure for the CNNsS.

%discussion on difference between YcbYcr and Cielab Effect of blur
\subsection{Comparing colorspace and effect of blur}
The only network using regression was the Compact network. Gaussian blur is used to allow the network to more easily converge towards a solution. Different kernel intensities for Gaussian blur are used, $\sigma = 0$, $\sigma = 3$ and $\sigma = 5$ which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:blur}. Using $\sigma = 0 $ results in a sepia image. This is likely an effect not being able to identify global features due to the noisy nature of the un-blurred image, disallowing the network to converge towards a solution. $\sigma = 3$ and $\sigma = 5$ however show promising results. The difference between both pictures is marginal, however a to high $\sigma$ will result in loss of fine details. This is why $\sigma = 3$ is chosen as optimal setting.

As for colorspace selection, a comparison is made on the Compact network that shows the effect of choice on colorspace. The comparison is made between YCbCr and CIELab. CIELab shows a marginal difference in saturation compared to YCbCr 


%overfitting of vgg16 so dataset too small
% using compact architectures better results
\subsection{Comparing network complexity}
Another aspect that can be noted is that Networks are prone to overfitting on the small dataset that is used. The fruit dataset consisted of 12000 unique images for training and 2000 images for validation. The most complex network is the VGG16 + classification network. T, this architecture has 512 feature maps in the bottleneck of the network. As can be seen in \ref{fig:overfit}, the VGG16 + classification network is evidently overfitting after ?? epochs.

%conclusion on best network







%Gaussian blur
%It is clear that the case with $\sigma=0$, i.e. no blur, the network was unable to find any colors. Using a blur radius of $\sigma=3$ or $\sigma=5$ leads to much better results. Between these two, the $\sigma=3$ case was chosen to be the best, since it seems more inclined to pick more saturated colors. A too high blur radius will also make the training less effective since the link between texture and color becomes weaker at the edges of objects.
