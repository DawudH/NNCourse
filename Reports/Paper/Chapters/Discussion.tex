\section{Discussion}

Defining a quantative performance measure of the networks is outside of the scope of this paper. Therefore a comparison of the results of the five architectures is mainly done by sight.

%comparison of datasets fruit and landscape, on compact net . Effect of blur.

%discussion on difference between YcbYcr and Cielab

%overfitting of vgg16 so dataset too small
% using compact architectures better results

%comparison between dilation, concat and dilation+concat

%final comparison between all architectures, show massive image.

%conclusion on best network
