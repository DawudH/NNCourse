Intro
	Reason for image colorization
	
	Types of image colorization (from literature review, but shorter?)
		by example
		by user input
		by a trained machine

	Research problem: 
		how to colorize an image using NN
		How to pick a color: mean in color space is sepia

	What is in the rest of this paper
	

Lit. review (actually previous attempts)
	VGG16
	Dahl
		batch norm
		concatenation
	Zhang
		dilation
		classification


Method
	Prerequisites (things used by all networks)
		Data set (fruit), (landscape)
		Input size (128X128)

	Color spaces + which one to use :
		RGB (luminosity not separated from color)
		HSV (circular domain)
		YCbCr (OK)
		CIELab (OK)
		first layer as input, second and third layer as output

	Architecture (not what it is but why WE use it)
		General discription (how to colorize an image with an NN)
		Features used by all networks
			ReLu, weight initialization, padding, kernel size
		Feature extraction
		Reconstruct
			Concatenate
			Dilated convolution
		Color generation
			Two feature maps
				blur
			Classification
				k-means
				annealed mean
				gaussian blur

		Loss function
			Squared error
				Class rebalancing (histogram dataset)
			Cross entropy
				Class rebalancing
		Architectures used:
			Dahl, Compact, Dahl_classifier, Dahl_zhang, Zhang

	Training method
		nesterov momentum
		adadelta

Results
	Show effect of colorspaces, blur, annealed mean
	Compare results of architectures (images, error plot, feature maps)
	


Discussion
	Final architecture for best performance
	Data set validity? is fruit a good test case?
	



Conclusion
Recommendations: What's next
	hyperparameters research (momentum etc)
	longer training
	bigger training set
	extend usage to all images



Things that were compared:
	Color space
	Blur
	Pretrained or not
	Classification or not
	Cost function
	Architecture
