\section{Time Schedule}
\label{TimeTable}

In table \ref{tab:timeallocation} a preliminary estimate of the time spent on each subject is made. There is no division of labor present which will be determined in a later stage of the project.

The amount of time spent on the literature study is a direct copy of the amount of ECTS available for the literature study. The remaining amount of time is also based on the assigned number of ECTS. This resulted in a total time to divide of 470.4 hours.

The determination of preliminary design choices will take up a considerable amount of time. This is mainly because an extensive literature study is required to get sufficient knowledge about to subject to make these preliminary design choices. However, when the information has been absorbed, only a day or two is necessary to determine how the neural network roughly is going to look like.

After these parameters have been established the actual design of the neural network has to begin. This is where most of the time assigned to the project is going to be put in. The design of the Neural Network architecture is determined to be the most time intensive task. 
This is mainly due to the fact that the design of the architecture is the most broad subject when compared to the other design subjects. The design of the cost function and training algorithm are a more specialized design, resulting in overall less time needed to design this element.
