\section{Literature Review}
Automatic image colorisation is a problem that has been attempted to solve using different approaches. At the basic level, there are three approaches to make the computer convert a grayscale image to a color image. Every approach uses the texture and intensity gradients to link to either a learned or specified color. The three approaches are:

image colorisation can be performed by using a target image that is related to the grayscale image in that it contains similar objects with similar colors. 
The approach the authors will use is of a trained neural network, tha
